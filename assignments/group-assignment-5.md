# Group Assignment 5: Inferential Stats

See the schedule in the syllabus for all assignment due dates and expectations. Group assignments need only one submission per group, so nominate a single submitter to submit on behalf of the whole group. You will be graded on your adherence to _all_ the instructions. Please read the instructions carefully.

You will analyze the data you downloaded in assignment 1, and optionally other new data as needed. Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed. Using the techniques we learned in class, do the following two things:

1. conduct a inferential analysis such as difference-in-means or estimate a population parameter from a sample
2. estimate and interpret a regression model

Each step above should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains your analysis, why you set it up the way you did, and how you interpret its results. This interpretation should include some induction (that is, interpret your coefficients numerically in terms of sign, size, and significance) and some abduction (that is, inference to the best explanation: how would you explain what's happening numerically here in the context of theory and your own real-world experience?). Tell us a story about the real world using your results. For your regression model, also explain how you specified it and why.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Click "Edit > Clear all outputs" and then "Runtime > Restart runtime". This clears your memory and re-initializes your notebook. Then click "Runtime > Run all" and make sure everything behaves properly. Then save and submit your notebook and any data files, all zipped together, via Blackboard.
