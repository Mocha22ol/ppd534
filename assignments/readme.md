# Assignments

See the schedule in the syllabus for all assignment due dates and expectations. Submissions are due by 23:59 on their due date.

Group assignments need only one submission per group, so nominate a single submitter to submit on behalf of the whole group.

You will be graded on your adherence to *all* the instructions. For some assignments, this includes specific file naming. For others, it includes writing short narratives in markdown describing what you did with your code, why, and interpreting what it means in the real world.
